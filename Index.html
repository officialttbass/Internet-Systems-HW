        <h1> Timothy Bass </h1>
        <p>
            My name is Timothy Bass, but you can call me Tim. I am a junior Computer Science major with
            a minor in Applied Mathematics from Goldsboro, North Carolina. This year, I am also serving
            as the Mr. ACM for the Association for Computing Machinery's chapter here at A&T. A little
            bit about myself: I am a first generation college student and also the first Aggie in the 
            family, I am the oldest of two, and I enjoy finding new passions in whatever form I can find
            it in, whether that be graphic desigining, photograpy, ux design, or any other outlet where 
            I can express my creativity.
